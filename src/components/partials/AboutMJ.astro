      As a multifaceted creative, I blend my expertise in graphic design, 3D
      modeling, and UI design with a passion for photography and filmography.
      Delving into freelancing in 2015, I embarked on a journey marked by
      exploration and innovation. Though my academic stint at a WSB university
      lasted three years before I opted to pursue my own path, it equipped me
      with foundational knowledge. My keen eye for aesthetics drives me to craft
      visually captivating experiences across various mediums. Beyond my primary
      disciplines, I dabble in web development, enriching my skill set and
      pushing the boundaries of digital artistry in my free time.

      Fueled by a diverse palette of influences, I infuse my creative endeavors
      with the pulsating rhythms and eclectic melodies of dubstep, drum & bass,
      pop, rock, and rap. Music isn't just a background soundtrack for meâ€”it's a
      driving force, inspiring my designs and cinematography with its energy and
      emotion. Whether I'm sculpting 3D landscapes, crafting intuitive UI
      interfaces, or capturing the perfect shot through my lens, the synergy
      between my passion for design and love for music shapes every project I
      undertake.
