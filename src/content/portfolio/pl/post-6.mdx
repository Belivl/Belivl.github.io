about: Woody FoodTruck is a small business started by a passionate group of friends that wanted to share their love for Italian food with others. Woody's built-in, wood-fired pizza oven is what makes them stand out from other businesses alike. They can handcraft the pizza in a way traditional Italians do. Thanks to the mobility of a food truck, they can serve their specialty wherever they please. You can taste their mouth-watering, fire-baked pizza at many food events and conventions.
