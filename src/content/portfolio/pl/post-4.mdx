about: Approached by a friend playing in the team, he cosulted with me what he would want to see and gave me the rest to be creatively directed. Color, mascot and displayed team name have been overwatched and controlled. Entire introductory video/animation was set to be in range between 10 - 20 seconds long enough to show the team spirit and short enough to be used in every montage the team would create. There is a red color variant of the intro avaiable for the team to be used as needed but wasnt built with the variant in mind.
