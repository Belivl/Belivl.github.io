about: Approached by a friend playing in the team, he cosulted with me what he would want to see and gave me the rest to be creatively directed. Color, mascot and displayed team name have been overwatched and controlled. Entire introductory video/animation was to be in range between 10 - 20 seconds long enough to show the team spirit and short enough to be used in every montage the team would make. There is a red color variant of the intro avaible to for the team to use as needed but wasnt built on it in mind.
