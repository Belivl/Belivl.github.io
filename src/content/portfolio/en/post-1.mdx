about: I've designed two dynamic visual variants for each event hosted at Bukszpryt Pub&Club. One set is tailored for impactful social media promotions, utilizing vibrant graphics and engaging typography. The other set is optimized for print and display, ensuring a consistent brand presence across physical mediums. My focus is on creating a visually captivating narrative for each event, enhancing audience engagement, and contributing to the overall success of Bukszpryt Pub&Club. Through collaborative discussions and a commitment to brand consistency, my designs aim to drive event interest, boost attendance, and amplify the unique atmosphere of every occasion.
