about: In crafting the visual identity for YaO's first mixtape, I employed a multi-dimensional approach. The album cover, a visual manifesto, captures my unique vision through stable diffusion techniques, ensuring a seamless blend with the thematic background. Dynamic banners for YouTube and Facebook serve as digital gateways, while two rap videos, captured candidly to maintain authenticity, bring YaO's lyrics to life.
