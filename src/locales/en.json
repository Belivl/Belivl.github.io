Specifically, I undertook a pivotal role in enhancing user interfaces and revamping the user experience for two key company offerings: the mobile app, \"Call App,\" and the primary service tool, \"FastTony Smart.\"\n Noteworthy accomplishments include the strategic decision to rewrite the home website, adopting the Laravel framework and refining its aesthetic appeal through the use of TailwindCSS and SCSS.
