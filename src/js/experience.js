        aboutWork: "In my role, I\'ve been immersed in a spectrum of design projects spanning mobile and web applications. I\'ve been instrumental in the entire process - from conceptualization to implementation, creating and refining templates that seamlessly translate into functional websites. Specifically, I undertook a pivotal role in enhancing user interfaces and revamping the user experience for two key company offerings: the mobile app, and the primary service tool. \n\n Noteworthy accomplishments include the strategic decision to rewrite the home website, adopting the framework and refining its aesthetic appeal through the use of TailwindCSS and SCSS. This overhaul not only ensured a more robust and scalable website but also contributed to an elevated visual identity in line with current design trends.\n\n In addition to my hands-on involvement in these projects, I\'ve also taken on a supervisory role, guiding and collaborating with a group of students during their practice hours. This experience has not only allowed me to contribute to their professional development but has also reinforced my ability to lead and mentor in a collaborative work environment. ",
